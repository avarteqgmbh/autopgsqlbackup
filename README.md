# autopgsqlbackup

Automatic PostgreSQL Backup Script based on [AutoMySQLBackup Script Ver 2.2](http://sourceforge.net/projects/automysqlbackup/)

# Acknowledgements

  * The PostgreSQL changes are based on a patch against AutoMySQLBackup 1.9 created by Friedrich Lobenstock <fl@fl.priv.at>

  * This script is based on [a Gist by Matthew Lehner](https://gist.github.com/matthewlehner/3091458), which appears to be code written by Aaron Axelsen.  I'm just putting here so I can keep track of it.
